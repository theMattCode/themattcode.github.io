# About Me

Hello! My name is Matthäus Mayer. I'm a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer based in southern Germany. I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world. Currently, in 2019, I start with contracting and freelancing beside my day job to gain experience in this field and to boot up the business.

I started learning C in 2001 and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.

## Technical Interests & Focus

I went through the stages of a full-stack developer from building desktop applications, backends and web frontends until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts and love to get feedback to constantly improve. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.

My interests primarily lie in building applications for the web. Technically, I focus on Golang, Java or PHP for the backend or desktop part and React (ES5/6) for frontend.

## Tools

Most of the time I work in IntelliJ IDEA and with the bash command line with iTerm2. I enjoy their features, integration, reliability and speed. For ad-hoc editing I use Visual Studio Code. In the past I have used Eclipse a lot.

## Workflow

I organize my tasks and micro management in a kanban-like approach with [Trello](https://trello.com) and follow the [Inbox Zero](https://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk) principle.

For some time now I have been following the premise of [Josh Kaufman's 20 hour rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), which, in my opinion, is a great way of putting pragmatism into practise and bringing me to my current situation. In addition, this opens up the possibility of solving problems and improving their goals and tasks.
