module.exports = "Hi! Mein Name ist Matthäus Mayer.\n\nI'm a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer based in southern Germany. I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world. Currently, in 2019, I start contracting and freelancing beside my day job to gain experience in this field and to boot up the business.\n\nI started learning C in 2001 when I was 16 years old and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.\n\n## Technical Interests & Focus\n\nI went through the stages of a full-stack developer from building desktop applications, backends and web frontends until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts and love to get feedback to constantly improve. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.\n\nTechnically, I focus on **Golang**, **Java** or PHP for the backend or desktop part and **React** (ES5/6) for frontend.  In past and current projects I have great success with **Docker**, **Kubernetes** and **Infrastructure as Code** at the operations part.\n\n## Tools\n\nMost of the time I work in IntelliJ IDEA and with the bash command line with iTerm2. I enjoy their features, integration, reliability and speed. For ad-hoc editing I use Visual Studio Code. In the past I have used Eclipse a lot.\n\n## Workflow\n\nI organize my tasks in a kanban-like approach with [Trello](https://trello.com) and follow the [Inbox Zero](https://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk) principle. I try to limit micromanagement to one day, but set priorities in a long-term roadmap.\n\nFor some time now I have been following the premise of [Josh Kaufman's 20 hour rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), which, in my opinion, is a great way of putting pragmatism into practise and bringing me to my current situation. In addition, this opens up the possibility of solving problems and iteratively improving whatever comes out.\n\n## Contact & Social Media\n\nPlease check in via:\n * Twitter: [@theMattCode](https://twitter.com/theMattCode)\n * E-Mail: m19@mayer.pub\n * Github: [theMattCode](https://github.com/theMattCode)\n * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthäus-mayer-714272148/)\n\n"
