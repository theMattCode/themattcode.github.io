My name is Matthäus Mayer. I'm a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer based in southern Germany. I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world.\\n\\nI started learning C in 2001 and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.\\n\\nI went through the stages of a full-stack developer until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts and love to get feedback to constantly improve. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.\\n\\nMy interests primarily lie in building applications for the web. I focus on Golang, Java or PHP for the backend or desktop part and React (ES5/6) for frontend.\\n\"","import React, {Fragment} from \"react\";\nimport ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\";\nimport Head from \"../components/Head/Head\";\nimport About from \"../content/index/about.md\";\n\nexport default () => (\n\t<Fragment>\n\t\t<Head title=\"Matthäus Mayer\"/>\n\t\t<ReactMarkdown source={About}/>\n\t</Fragment>\n)\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAHA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
