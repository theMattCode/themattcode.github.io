I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world. Currently, in 2019, I start with contracting and freelancing beside my day job to gain experience in this field and to boot up the business.\n\nI started learning C in 2001 and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.\n\n# Technical Interests & Focus\n\nI went through the stages of a full-stack developer until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts and love to get feedback to constantly improve. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.\n\nMy interests primarily lie in building applications for the web. Technically, I focus on Golang, Java or PHP for the backend or desktop part and React (ES5/6) for frontend.\n\n# Tools, Workflow and Mindset\n\nMost of the time I work in IntelliJ IDEA and on the bash command line with iTerm2. I love the auto-completion for speed in both tools. I use   \n\nFor some time now I have been following the premise of [Josh Kaufman's 20 hour rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), which, in my opinion, is a great way of putting pragmatism into practise and bringing me to my current situation. In addition, this opens up the possibility of solving problems and improving their goals and tasks.\n\n# Contact & Social Media\n\nPlease check in via:\n * Twitter: [@theMattCode](https://twitter.com/theMattCode)\n * E-Mail: matthaeus@mayer.pub\n * Github: [theMattCode](https://github.com/theMattCode)\n * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthäus-mayer-714272148/)\n\n"
