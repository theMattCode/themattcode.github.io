module.exports = "Hello! My name is Matth√§us Mayer. I'm a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer based in southern Germany. I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world. Currently, I start with contracting and freelancing beside my day job to gain experience in this field and to streamline the business.\n\nI started learning C in 2001 and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.\n\nI went through the stages of a full-stack developer until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts and love to get feedback to constantly improve. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.\n\nFor some time now I have been following the premise of [Josh Kaufman's 20 hour rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY), which, in my opinion, is a great way of putting pragmatism into practise and bringing me to my current situation.\n\nMy interests primarily lie in building applications for the web. Technically, I focus on Golang, Java or PHP for the backend or desktop part and React (ES5/6) for frontend.\n\nContact via twitter @theMattCode or e-mail matthaeus@mayer.pub."
