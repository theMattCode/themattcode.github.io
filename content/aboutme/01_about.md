Hello! My name is Matth√§us Mayer. I'm a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer based in southern Germany. I am extremely passionate about developing robust and modern applications. Overall, I'm an IT and technology enthusiast and love to live in a digitalized world.

I started learning C in 2001 and continued with PHP, HTML and CSS. The first major completed project was an asset management web application in 2003 while I completed my apprenticeship at Hewlett-Packard. Since then, I have studied Business Informatics up to my Master's degree and have been employed as a software developer and DevOps engineer.

I went through the stages of a full-stack developer until I concentrated on fully automated development workflows and continuously integrated and deployed cloud-native systems. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries, programming philosophies and concepts. This experience and a quick grasp allows a variety of uses for my skills.

My interests primarily lie in building applications for the web. I focus on Golang, Java or PHP for the backend or desktop part and React (ES5/6) for frontend.
